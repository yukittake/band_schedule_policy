    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: 2025-09-07</p>

    <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the <strong>バンドスケジュール</strong> app (hereby referred to as the
      “Application”) for mobile devices that was created by <strong>Suzuki Yukitake</strong>
      (hereby referred to as the “Service Provider”) as a Free service. This service is intended
      for use “AS IS”.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      The Application does <strong>not collect or transmit</strong> any personally identifiable information (PII)
      to the Service Provider or to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users may enter band member names and schedule information into the Application.
      This information is <strong>stored locally on the user’s device only</strong> and is not shared, transmitted,
      or otherwise made accessible to the Service Provider or to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Application does not gather precise location data, nor does it collect network identifiers
      such as IP addresses or analytics about your usage.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.
      Since all data is stored locally on the device and is not transmitted externally, children’s
      information is not accessible to the Service Provider. If you believe a child has provided
      personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through any means, please contact
      the Service Provider so that necessary actions can be taken.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      Because all data is stored locally on your device, the confidentiality of your information
      depends on your device’s security features (such as operating system protections and device
      access controls). The Service Provider does not receive or store any user data.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. Any changes will be posted
      on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically, as continued use of
      the Application constitutes acceptance of any changes.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, please contact
      the Service Provider at
      <a href="mailto:wk247dev@gmail.com">wk247dev@gmail.com</a>.
